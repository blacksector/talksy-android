#Talksy (Android)

Talksy is a simple and fast mobile application designed for private messaging with end to end encryption. Future plans include voice and video calling.
The idea behind Talksy is that it will remain free and open source for the general public to truly understand the logic and work behind the system and allow people to learn the "secrets" behind a encrypted chatting application.

## How to use it?
At the moment, Talksy is still in UI stages and I am still making the UI and small configurations and settings. The server side API is still heavily under development and I am still deciding on which software to use for backend implementation. My proposed idea is a pub-sub channel messaging gateway, sort of like Pusher. I may possibly use a open source solution like Poxa or Slanger.
So to answer the question, you can't really use it at the moment.

## Why make Talksy?
I always wanted to understand the works of a application like WhatsApp and also learn the security behind it along with advanced app development. Disclaimer, this is my very first native android app, previously I only made Cordova applications. Talksy also gives people a way to learn the steps and code behind an application like WhatsApp, plus I plan to possibly release this on the Play store to benefit the general public.

More updates to come!
